# How did I end up here??

I will first have to give a warning to anyone reading; I'm 99% sure I shouldn't have passed beyond 8th grade reading/writing and my writing skills haven’t grown much since then, so I'm sorry if this blog post is a bit too informal for y'alls taste. 

This blog will sort of be like a diary entry, a 'How did I end up here at Flatiron' story, and it all begins post college. I graduated with a dual degree in mathematics and computer science, so you’d imagine with a setup like that getting a job would be easy! And it truly could have been if I wasn’t such a dumb immature bastard growing up. Landing interviews for software engineering was easy, the dual degree must have looked tasty to recruiters, but where it all fell apart was the interviews. 

# My guy how did you mess up so bad with 2 degrees???

Looking back, I really shouldn’t have been allowed to get my degree in computer science. I graduated not understanding what an IDE was (absolutely WILD right??), not knowing or understanding the ‘development cycle’, and chose to party and let all that necessary knowledge go in one ear and straight out my ass. At those interviews I got NUKED to the ground. So after each interview I would try to study up on what I shat the bed on, only to get clowned on different concepts on the next interview over and over again. Shit went down so bad I don’t even remember what those questions were.

After so many botched interviews, I essentially gave up. I said ‘well guess i’m not meant to be a coder, so I guess I’ll rot???’ I got a few regular jobs here and there; working at a deli, helping stores set up in malls, ya know things a math/comp sci degree are needed for! But I landed one job that had set me down a path which would be a blessing and a curse; tutoring.

I tutored k-8th grade mathematics for gifted and struggling kids, and surprisingly I loved it! To encourage those interested in STEM to pursue their dreams, and to help those struggling to understand was a fulfilling job, and this gave me an idea to pursue becoming a high school math teacher. I figured my brain is sadly still zoomer humor, deep fried memes still make me laugh, so the teaching field can’t be that bad for me right? -insert ‘How do ya do, fellow kids’ meme-

***ENTER HELL***

Man, I was incredibly WRONG on my perception of teaching, being a teacher truly is one of the most difficult things I have ever done, and I am walking away with an absolute massive amount of respect for those who are teachers.

The absolute DISRESPECT in the classroom is astonishing, and the education system for those who don’t do well is an absolute joke.

There were really 2 things that broke the straw on my back. First was the structure of classes the Freshman needed to take in my district; regular algebra, even for those who should not have passed 8th grade math, AND PHYSICS SIMULTANEOUSLY? The physics teacher and I tried to push back, it was so obviously a bad idea. And to be honest the replies were such convoluted dog piss I stopped trying eventually. Watching these kids drag their head across the ground, essentially taking 2 math classes in one day truly made me sad. No shit they hate math, they have to deal with it twice a day with gapped knowledge. Physics, a subject HEAVILY needing understanding in algebra, WHILE taking algebra. I would have loved to slow down, but I had a curriculum that I MUST stick to, and would get dogged on if I fell behind by higher ups. Disgusting broken structure.

The other straw was simply the attitude of kids. I tried my best to :) and keep on teaching while they told me math is dog shit, why is it even needed, deal with “fUcK YouR hOmeWoRk”, ect… One day, I talked about the potential future of using math and how there are jobs out there who pay well for simply analyzing data. (I was already looking into data analysis anyways to change careers) So one of the kids yell back at me ‘fuck you why don’t you go do that yourself’. 

You know what.

Fuck you too you’re right, I will.

So I gave my 2 weeks that day and quit :) 

# Conclusion
And now I’m here. I combed through many bootcamps and decided on Flatiron which was accredited to have a great hire rate post graduation, my weakness from before. And I picked data science over data analysis since I had a computer science background and wanted the challenge of creating my own code. 

The blessing from teaching is now I'm not even nervous at all to talk to large crowds. Talking to adults and conveying concepts could NEVER be as bad as what I went through for the past 4 years. The other blessing is a bit more personal; I think teaching has finally matured me. I truly now appreciate the education I have, the knowledge I possess and I finally had the conviction to tell myself; ‘I want more, I can do more with this life, and I finally know what I want to pursue’.  Analyzing data is something I already have been doing as a kid in Maplestory and I loved it! The things I would have to do as work are already things I enjoy doing on my own. And to boil down complicated ideas to understandable words? I have quite the experience for that.

I’m glad I found Flatiron, my time so far has been great with the instructor, the material is fun, and the support offered to students is outstanding. I am grateful for this opportunity and will not squander the potential from this knowledge gained as I did earlier in my life.
